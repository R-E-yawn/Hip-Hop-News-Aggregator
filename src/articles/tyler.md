Now, to the good part :)

One thing I think is important to understand an album is to understand WHY an artist made an album, what their life situation was when they made it, and what message they are trying to say with their music.

This album is clearly meant to be goofy, and intended to be more so a palette cleanser for the listener than an intentional work of art. This is on brand for Tyler, the Creator, who is known for his goofy personality, and his message of not being too rigid on one's music taste. 

In an interview, he mentions it irks him when people try to tell younger people what their taste in music should be, and that he notices that lots of young people try to listen to Tupac and Wu-Tang clan because they feel like they SHOULD like that music. Too many people try to be RIGHT in their music taste, to listen to the right music, when he mentions he wants to know why THEY like a specific rapper, and he wants to hear about their life experiences and what they were going through when they listened to a particular album. 

This is very relevant to understand his new album, because this album is very different. It's not even clear what the first song is about?? It sounds like he's doing an intro as a robot haha.

I won't go into detail about any particular song, because you can go listen to the album for yourself, but my FAVORITE song on the album is Tel Me What It Is. This song has a really nice, soothing melody, and really simple lyrics. It's a nice song to listen to late at night or on a long car drive with friends. 

However, I will mention, as a big fan of more melodic artists like The Weeknd and Frank Ocean, I have a hard time relating to this album in general. The drums are irregular, and the songs don't seem to have a very strong message or story, which contrasts heavily with the dark, thematic songs of The Weeknd or the sunset, picturesque songs of Frank Ocean. As a listener, this album came across like it was intended for a more niche audience, which is totally fair.
